## Build instructions

To install the dependencies for building, please run this command.

```bash
npm ci
```

To build the library, please run this command.

```bash
npm run build
```

## Examples

We are currently hosting some examples in the `examples` folder. To run them, please visit https://processing.github.io/p5.sound.js/examples/

## Current state

### Working

- p5.SoundFile: it's able to playback files, since we are removing build dependencies, such as preval and audioworklet-polyfill, it is right now only able to play back sound, not loop it.
-  p5.Oscillator: working, without amplitude or frequency modulation, or panning.

### Buggy

- p5.Amplitude: early stages of implementation
- p5.AudioIn: early stages of implementation
- p5.AnalyzerFFT: former name was p5.FFT
- p5.Envelope: work in progress on getting rid of Tone.js dependencies
- p5.Delay: took out the lowpass filter
- p5.Filter: not tested yet

### Coming soon

- p5.SoundRecorder
- p5.Reverb

### Deprecated (for now)

- userStartAudio
- p5.MonoSynth and p5.PolySynth
- p5.SoundLoop, p5.Phrase, p5.Part and p5.Score
- p5.Convolver

## Modules adapted from Tone.js r10

One of the big goals of this new version of the p5.sound.js library, we are trying to minimize the dependencies,
and at the time the original library was built, Tone.js was imported.

So we are adapting the original modules that are needed from Tone.js, and adding them here.

- [Signal.js](./src/Signal.js)
- [SignalAdd.js](./src/SignalAdd.js)
- [SignalBase.js](./src/SignalBase.js)
- [SignalMultiply.js](./src/SignalMultiply.js)
- [SignalScale.js](./src/SignalScale.js)
- [TimeLineSignal.js](./src/TimeLineSignal.js)
- [WaveShaper.js](./src/WaveShaper.js)

## Help wanted

- p5.SoundFile: please help us fix the AudioWorklet and build for this.
