## Current state

### Working

- AnalyzerFFT
- BiquadFilter
- Delay
- Noise
- Oscillator
- SoundFile
- 
### Buggy

- p5.Amplitude: early stages of implementation
- p5.AudioIn: early stages of implementation
- p5.Envelope: work in progress on getting rid of Tone.js dependencies

### Coming soon

- p5.SoundRecorder
- p5.Reverb

### Deprecated (for now)

- userStartAudio
- MonoSynth and PolySynth
- SoundLoop, Phrase, Part and Score

After a fruitful discussion with the Tone.js team, we are adding Tone.js 14.x.x as a dependency when we need it, and updating its references.
